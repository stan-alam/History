But it was worse than that. When volcanoes erupt, they don’t expel only lava, but also heat, dust, and noxious gases. Unlike lava, these can affect the entire planet. At the end of the Permian, these were the real agents of doom, and they started a cascade of destruction that would last for millions of years and irrevocably change the world in the process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

It was the biggest episode of mass death in the history of our planet. Somewhere around 90 percent of all species disappeared. Paleontologists have a special term for an event like this, when huge numbers of plants and animals die out all around the world in a short time: a mass extinction. There have been five particularly severe mass extinctions over the past 500 million years. The one 66 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period, which wiped out the dinosaurs, is surely the most famous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

A global ice age—which covered nearly the entire planet in glaciers, down to the tropics—came and went, and in its aftermath the first animals got their start. They were simple at first—soft sacs of goo like sponges and jellyfish, until they invented shells and skeletons. Around 540 million years ago, during the Cambrian Period, these skeletonized forms exploded in diversity, became extremely abundant, started eating one another, and began forming complex ecosystems in the oceans. Some of these animals formed a skeleton made of bones—these were the first vertebrates, and they looked like flimsy little minnows. But they, too, continued to diversify and eventually some of them turned their fins into arms, grew fingers and toes, and emerged onto the land, about 390 million years ago. These were the first tetrapods, and their descendants include all vertebrates that live on land today: frogs and salamanders, crocodiles and snakes, and then later, dinosaurs and us.|

The world was clearly recovering from the shock of end-Permian volcanoes. Then, about 250 million years ago, just a couple of million years after the extinction, a new type of track starts showing up. They’re small, just a few centimeters long, about the size of a cat’s paw. They are arranged in narrow trackways, the five-fingered handprints positioned in front of the slightly larger footprints, which have three long central toes flanked by a tiny toe on each side. The best place to find them is near a tiny Polish village called Stryczowice, where you can park your car at a bridge, scramble your way through thorns and bramble, and poke around the banks of a narrow stream littered with track-covered rock slabs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Remarkably, both of these lineages survive today. The first, the pseudosuchians, later gave rise to crocodiles. As shorthand, they are usually referred to as the crocodile-line archosaurs. The second, the avemetatarsalians, developed into pterosaurs (the flying reptiles often called pterodactyls), dinosaurs, and by extension the birds that, as we shall see, descended from the dinosaurs. This group is called the bird-line archosaurs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

These minerals are made up of certain elements, in our case including potassium. One isotope (atomic form) of potassium (potassium-40) is not stable, but slowly undergoes a process called radioactive decay, in which it changes into argon-40 and expels a small amount of radiation, causing the beeps you’d hear on a Geiger counter. Beginning the moment a rock solidifies, its unstable potassium starts changing into argon. As this process continues, the accumulating argon gas becomes trapped inside the rock where it can be measured. We know from lab experiments the rate at which potassium-40 changes into argon-40. Knowing this rate, we can take a rock, measure the percentages of the two isotopes, and calculate how old the rock is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Sometimes a paleontologist is lucky and finds a dinosaur bone sandwiched between two layers of datable volcanic rocks that provide a time envelope for when that dinosaur must have lived. There are other methods that can date individual crystals found in sandstones and mudstones, but these are expensive and time-consuming. This means that it’s often difficult to date dinosaurs accurately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

There was little funding and, believe it or not, little public interest. Things picked up again in the late 1980s, when a thirty-something paleontologist from Chicago named Paul Sereno put together a joint Argentine-American team of other ambitious young guns, mostly graduate students and junior professors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Given enough time and a good pair of shoes, you could walk from the Arctic Circle across the equator to the South Pole. If you ventured too far inland, you would find yourself many thousands of miles—tens of thousands, even—from the closest beach. But if you fancied a swim, you could take a dip in the vast ocean surrounding the big slab of land you called home and, theoretically at least, paddle from one coast all the way around the planet to the other coast without having to dry off.

—a new species of dinosaur is currently being found, on average, once a week. Let
that sink in: a new dinosaur every . . . single . . . week. That’s about fifty new
species each year—Zhenyuanlong among them."
― from "The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs: A New History of a Lost World"

"Most of all, though, I want to show that dinosaurs were not aliens, nor were
they failures, and they’re certainly not irrelevant. They were remarkably successful,
thriving for over 150 million years"
― from "The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs: A New History of a Lost World"

"There were slimy salamanders bigger than dogs, loitering near the water’s edge
and occasionally snapping at a passing fish."

"beasts called pareiasaurs waddled around on all fours,"

"The constant supply of heat from the deep Earth is what powers Old Faithful
and the other geysers. This same thing was happening at the end of the Permian
Period, but on a continent-wide scale.
