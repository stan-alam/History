## Rise And Fall of the Dinosaurs

```text
—a new species of dinosaur is currently being found, on average, once a week. Let
that sink in: a new dinosaur every . . . single . . . week. That’s about fifty new
species each year—Zhenyuanlong among them."
― from "The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs: A New History of a Lost World"

"Most of all, though, I want to show that dinosaurs were not aliens, nor were
they failures, and they’re certainly not irrelevant. They were remarkably successful,
thriving for over 150 million years"
― from "The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs: A New History of a Lost World"

"There were slimy salamanders bigger than dogs, loitering near the water’s edge
and occasionally snapping at a passing fish."

"beasts called pareiasaurs waddled around on all fours,"

"The constant supply of heat from the deep Earth is what powers Old Faithful
and the other geysers. This same thing was happening at the end of the Permian
Period, but on a continent-wide scale.
