## notes on 'Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs'

```text
n this brilliant exploration of our cosmic environment, the renowned particle physicist and New York Times
bestselling author of Warped Passages and Knocking on Heaven’s Door uses her research into
dark matter to illuminate the startling connections between the furthest reaches of space and life here on Earth.

Sixty-six million years ago, an object the size of a city descended from space to crash
into Earth, creating a devastating cataclysm that killed off the dinosaurs, along with
three-quarters of the other species on the planet. What was its origin? In Dark Matter
and the Dinosaurs, Lisa Randall proposes it was a comet that was dislodged from its orbit
as the Solar System passed through a disk of dark matter embedded in the Milky Way. In a
sense, it might have been dark matter that killed the dinosaurs.

Working through the background and consequences of this proposal, Randall shares with us the
latest findings—established and speculative—regarding the nature and role of dark matter and
the origin of the Universe, our galaxy, our Solar System, and life, along with the process by
which scientists explore new concepts. In Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs, Randall tells a
breathtaking story that weaves together the cosmos’ history and our own, illuminating the deep
relationships that are critical to our world and the astonishing beauty inherent in the most familiar things.

“Engrossing in its own right, this theory opens onto an illuminating survey of the cutting-edge
science now deployed to test its components, including its daring redefinition of dark matter.
As she did in Warped Passages (2005) and Knocking on Heaven’s Door (2011), Randall delivers
intellectual exhilaration.”
