##  notes on 'Against the grain'
**James C. Scott**
```text
Why did humans abandon hunting and gathering for sedentary communities dependent
on livestock and cereal grains, and governed by precursors of today’s states?
Most people believe that plant and animal domestication allowed humans, finally,
to settle down and form agricultural villages, towns, and states, which made
possible civilization, law, public order, and a presumably secure way of living.
But archaeological and historical evidence challenges this narrative. The first
agrarian states, says James C. Scott, were born of accumulations of domestications:
first fire, then plants, livestock, subjects of the state, captives, and finally
women in the patriarchal family—all of which can be viewed as a way of gaining
control over reproduction.

Scott explores why we avoided sedentism and plow agriculture, the advantages of
mobile subsistence, the unforeseeable disease epidemics arising from crowding
plants, animals, and grain, and why all early states are based on millets and
cereal grains and unfree labor. He also discusses the “barbarians” who
long evaded state control, as a way of understanding continuing tension
between states and nonsubject peoples.
