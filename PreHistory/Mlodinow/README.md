## Notes on The Upright Thinkers: The Human Journey from Living in Trees
## to Understanding the Cosmos
```text
A few million years ago, our ancestors came down from the trees and began to stand
upright, freeing our hands to create tools and our minds to grapple with the world around us.

Leonard Mlodinow takes us on a passionate and inspiring tour through the exciting
history of human progress and the key events in the development of science. In the
process, he presents a fascinating new look at the unique characteristics of our species
and our society that helped propel us from stone tools to written language and through
the birth of chemistry, biology, and modern physics to today’s technological world.

Along the way he explores the cultural conditions that influenced scientific thought
through the ages and the colorful personalities of some of the great philosophers,
scientists, and thinkers: Galileo, who preferred painting and poetry to medicine and
dropped out of university; Isaac Newton, who stuck needlelike bodkins into his eyes to
better understand changes in light and color; and Antoine Lavoisier, who drank nothing
but milk for two weeks to examine its effects on his body. Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein,
Werner Heisenberg, and many lesser-known but equally brilliant minds also populate these pages,
each of their stories showing how much of human achievement can be attributed to the stubborn
pursuit of simple questions (why? how?), bravely asked.

The Upright Thinkers is a book for science lovers and for anyone interested in creative
thinking and in our ongoing quest to understand our world. At once deeply informed,
accessible, and infused with the author’s trademark wit, this insightful work is a stunning
tribute to humanity’s intellectual curiosity.
“Mlodinow never fails to make science both accessible and entertaining.” —Stephen Hawking,
author of A Brief History of Time

“Powerful. . . . Breath[es] new life into science history. [Mlodinow] frames narratives of
great thinkers with serial scenes of his father’s great courage and curiosity.” —Publishers Weekly
