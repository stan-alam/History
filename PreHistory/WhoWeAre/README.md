## notes on 'Who We Are'

```text
Here is a groundbreaking book about how the extraction of DNA from ancient bones has profoundly
changed our understanding of human prehistory while resolving many long-standing controversies.

Massive technological innovations now allow scientists to extract and analyze ancient
DNA as never before, and it has become clear—in part from David Reich’s own
contributions to the field—that genomics is as important a means of understanding
the human past as archeology, linguistics, and the written word. In Who We Are and
How We Got Here, Reich describes with unprecedented clarity just how the human genome
provides not only all the information that a fertilized human egg needs to develop
but also contains within it the history of our species. He explains how the genomic
revolution and ancient DNA are transforming our understanding of the lineage of modern
humans and how DNA studies reveal the deep history of inequality—among different
populations, between the sexes, and among individuals within a population. His book
gives the lie to the orthodoxy that there are no meaningful biological differences
among human populations, and at the same time uses the definitive evidence provided by
genomics to show that the differences that do exist are unlikely to conform to familiar
stereotypes.
