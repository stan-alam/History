Note: Different types of intelligence.

The rea­son that it ex­erts such fas­ci­na­tion is that it in­volves a form of in­tel­li­gence ex­ter­nal to hu­man­ity. A com­plete in­tel­li­gence, fully con­scious of it­self and the im­mense com­plex­ity of ma­te­rial re­al­ity. But an in­tel­li­gence that is not ours.

The ar­chae­ol­o­gist, like the an­thro­pol­o­gist, should force them­selves to see both from near and from far, to para­phrase Claude Lévi-Strauss.

Rousseau won­dered whether the great apes were hu­man, con­trary to those who de­nied the hu­man­ity of ‘sav­ages’, even though they were in fact Homo sapi­ens of a dif­fer­ent cul­ture.

The bor­ders of hu­man­ity have al­ways been un­cer­tain and in­dis­tinct, and many so­ci­eties con­sider an­i­mals to be on a level with hu­mans,

The clos­ing pages of these text­books of­fer of­ten al­lu­sive con­clu­sions about what they re­ally were, since of course nei­ther the shape of our skulls nor the curve of our fe­murs nor the po­si­tion of our thumbs has ever de­fined what it is that makes us hu­man be­ings. 

The sec­ond cat­e­gory is much more dis­creet, be­cause those who have doubts are usu­ally more re­served in ex­press­ing them­selves. It is usu­ally this more silent type who has mud un­der their fin­ger­nails and who is con­stantly scratch­ing around and ex­am­in­ing the re­mains left by the crea­ture. So who the hell was this Ne­an­derthal?

Not that we get any clearer an im­age. We dress the crea­ture up, nar­cis­sis­ti­cally, like we hang clothes on a scare­crow. Hav­ing dis­ap­peared from the earth, the Ne­an­derthal has been trans­formed, is still be­ing trans­formed, by us into a life­less doll. Vic­tor Franken­stein was only an ex­per­i­menter, a pre­cur­sor. We are the macabre in­ven­tors, the pup­pet mas­ters of these mar­i­onettes from times gone

Show­ing a slide of a Ne­an­derthal skull, he com­mented: ‘I don’t know about you, but if I got on a plane and saw that the pi­lot had a head like that, I’d get off again.’ Laugh­ter all round, a well-timed joke to catch the at­ten­tion of the au­di­ence. But all jokes re­veal an un­der­ly­ing thought, and this was not an in­signif­i­cant thought. Let me put this an­other way. A few years later, in Rus­sia, I had a con­ver­sa­tion with a lead­ing light of the Acad­emy of Sci­ences who never stopped telling me, ‘They are dif­fer­ent.’ I prompted

my com­pan­ion to ex­pand on this con­cept of dif­fer­ence. The dis­cus­sion went on into the small hours: ‘Lu­dovic, they have no soul.’

In the West, as in ev­ery tra­di­tional so­ci­ety, any­one who trans­gresses taboos is vi­o­lently re­jected, ban­ished from the group.
 If the Ne­an­derthal were a hu­man­ity dif­fer­ent from our own, hu­man with­out be­ing hu­man, it would force us to trans­gress the deep­est taboos of our so­ci­ety.

We have yet to per­ceive the crea­ture in any tan­gi­ble form in our minds. There are thou­sands of books which tell the story of our re­search, of our rep­re­sen­ta­tions of the Ne­an­derthal, the struc­ture of its bones, the car­tog­ra­phy of its sites, its tech­nolo­gies or its ge­net­ics – huge en­cy­clo­pe­dias filled with facts. But be­neath their sci­en­tific ve­neer there is no real thought in them, no phi­los­o­phy, no over­view or close-up view.
