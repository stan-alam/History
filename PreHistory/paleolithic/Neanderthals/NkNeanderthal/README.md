Show­ing a slide of a Ne­an­derthal skull, he com­mented: ‘I don’t know about you, but if I got on a plane and saw that the pi­lot had a head like that, I’d get off again.’ Laugh­ter all round, a well-timed joke to catch the at­ten­tion of the au­di­ence. But all jokes re­veal an un­der­ly­ing thought, and this was not an in­signif­i­cant thought. Let me put this an­other way.

 If the Ne­an­derthal were a hu­man­ity dif­fer­ent from our own, hu­man with­out be­ing hu­man, it would force us to trans­gress the deep­est taboos of our so­ci­ety.

We have yet to per­ceive the crea­ture in any tan­gi­ble form in our minds. There are thou­sands of books which tell the story of our re­search, of our rep­re­sen­ta­tions of the Ne­an­derthal, the struc­ture of its bones, the car­tog­ra­phy of its sites, its tech­nolo­gies or its ge­net­ics – huge en­cy­clo­pe­dias filled with facts.

At this time, Eura­sia was cov­ered by icy wastes, and the Ne­an­derthal, for the dozens of mil­len­nia up to its ex­tinc­tion, was a po­lar crea­ture. But there is po­lar and there is po­lar – and ar­chae­o­log­i­cal re­search shows that a very small num­ber of Palae­olithic so­ci­eties col­o­nized the bo­real spa­ces of the Rus­sian Arc­tic even when the planet was plunged into the deep­est ice age.

There is a piece of Inuit wis­dom that might be summed up as fol­lows: cold is never a prob­lem for hu­mans. Ac­cess to pro­teins and sta­ple food­stuffs is the only fac­tor that lim­its hu­man ex­pan­sion. Our bod­ies are not very sus­cep­ti­ble to cold when it is dry, and these Eurasian po­lar re­gions of the last age were markedly dry, prob­a­bly even arid, in their cold­ness. In ‘feels like’ terms to­day, it is colder in St Pe­ters­burg in Feb­ru­ary at -16 °C than in the con­ti­nen­tal ex­panses of Siberia at -30 °C. Dur­ing my re­search in the po­lar re­gions, I had to ex­per­i­ment with the re­ac­tion of my own me­tab­o­lism when, for weeks on end, I was daily ex­posed to tem­per­a­tures of -25 °C.

 Though there are only three po­lar sites con­tain­ing ob­jects fash­ioned by the hu­man hand, in 2016 the Amer­i­can jour­nal Sci­ence an­nounced the dis­cov­ery of a mam­moth car­cass bear­ing traces of butch­ery us­ing stone tools. The mam­moth was dis­cov­ered on the Taymyr penin­sula, some 600 kilo­me­tres north of the Arc­tic Cir­cle. The Taymyr penin­sula is lo­cated on the top end of the Ural moun­tains, in the far north-west of Siberia.

The Yenisey rises near the Mon­go­lian bor­der. It crosses the whole of Siberia be­fore flow­ing an­other 5,000 kilo­me­tres north into the Arc­tic Ocean. It is an­other Siberian su­per-river, like the Ob. The mam­moth ves­tiges lay a few hun­dred me­tres from the po­lar weather sta­tion at Sopochnaya Karga. A swiftly as­sem­bled ar­chae­o­log­i­cal op­er­a­tion man­aged to ex­tract the whole of the pachy­derm’s re­mains in a sin­gle block, which was frozen and sent by cargo plane to the re­search in­sti­tute in St Pe­ters­burg.

The mam­moth was re­mark­ably well pre­served and still re­tained traces of flesh and fur. Anal­y­sis of the re­mains showed marks
Note: Important

The marks were in­dis­putably in­flicted by stone tools and showed that the an­i­mal was slaugh­tered and its flesh re­moved, in­clud­ing its tongue, be­hav­iour well doc­u­mented among other Palae­olithic hunter pop­u­la­tions in more southerly re­gions of Eura­sia. But no tools or traces of the hunters were found in the vicin­ity of the car­cass. Car­bon-14 dat­ing showed that this mam­moth lived no later than 48,000 years ago. Such an as­ton­ish­ing dis­cov­ery proves that hu­mans oc­cu­pied the bo­real re­gions far be­yond the Arc­tic Cir­cle at a time when Homo sapi­ens hadn’t even be­gun to col­o­nize the Eu­ro­pean con­ti­nent.

By all ev­i­dence, in the mid­dle of the ice age, these peo­ple of the far north not only sur­vived but thrived in en­vi­ron­ments that to us seem ex­treme, but which in fact con­tained re­mark­able riches. The ex­ca­va­tions re­vealed re­mains of thou­sands of hares, which in­form us that Lep­ori­dae were trapped in a sys­tem­atic fash­ion.

The peo­ple of Yana showed no in­ter­est in their flesh but ex­ploited small game an­i­mals only for their skins: soft, warm, but also very frag­ile. Jean Malau­rie, the French po­lar ex­plorer, who lived in Green­land with the Inuit of Thule in the 1950s, re­counted that the small com­mu­nity with whom he spent a few sea­sons might hunt up to 1,500 hares each year just for their skins, as they con­sid­ered their meat rather in­sipid.
