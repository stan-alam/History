## notes on 21 lessons

```text
Yuval Noah Harari’s 21 Lessons for the 21st Century is a probing and visionary
investigation into today’s most urgent issues as we move into the uncharted
territory of the future. As technology advances faster than our understanding of it,
hacking becomes a tactic of war, and the world feels more polarized than ever, Harari
addresses the challenge of navigating life in the face of constant and disorienting change
and raises the important questions we need to ask ourselves in order to survive.

In twenty-one accessible chapters that are both provocative and profound, Harari
builds on the ideas explored in his previous books, untangling political, technological,
social, and existential issues and offering advice on how to prepare for a very different
future from the world we now live in: How can we retain freedom of choice when Big Data is
watching us? What will the future workforce look like, and how should we ready ourselves
for it? How should we deal with the threat of terrorism? Why is liberal democracy in crisis?
