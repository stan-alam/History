The group affects and shapes the memories of the individual.11 In a Spartan context, then, the way the community commemorated war would be vitally important for how individual Spartans remembered war and thought about current wars and their own roles in them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Assmann concedes that the subject of memory must be the individual, but the individual can organize and make sense of this memory only by relying on the “frame” provided by culture.12 Assmann elaborates on the relationship between the individual and the collective in terms of memory:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The difference is that the group memory has no neurological basis. This is replaced by culture: a complex of identity-shaping aspects of knowledge objectified in the symbolic forms of myth, song, dance, sayings, laws, sacred texts, pictures, ornaments, paintings, processional routes, or – as in the case of the Australians – even whole landscapes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

I think Xenophon’s comment, written in the 4th century bce rather than during the Roman period, concerning Spartan professionalism as compared to other Greeks is pretty hard to overcome: “Seeing these things [Sparta’s sacrificial practices in preparation for battle], you would reckon that others were mere novices in military matters, while the Lacedaemonians alone are in fact craftsmen in the art of war” (Xen.                                                                                                                                                           |

The Spartan idea of the “beautiful death” and its attendant glory even, or especially, in the context of defeat, was fully formed in the Archaic period, well before Thermopylae .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|Highlight (Yellow)                            |Location 963 |        |My conclusion, perhaps counterintuitive, is that Sparta fought more wars when it changed from emphasizing the glory of war for the individual and/or the Spartan state, often to the detriment of sound strategy and tactics, to claiming to fight for freedom and in the service of the Greeks. Though this latter form of commemoration is much more in line with our own commemorative sensibilities, and might strike us as somehow “better,” it had the effect of making war more, rather than less, likely – and might still do so today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

But I saved myself. What do I care about that shield? To hell with it. I’ll get another one just as good.”13 Archilochus, a poet living on the islands of Paros and Thasos , and flourishing nearly two centuries before Thermopylae, calls into question this notion of military virtue, which tells us that holding on to your shield at all costs was a Greek, rather than strictly Spartan, ideal, and one that predates the Persian Wars by a lot.14 Plutarch, we should note, says that the Spartans banned Archilochus from their city because of this poem – likely an apocryphal story, but tantalizing nonetheless (Inst.|

Both authors point to the shame , aischron , that accompanies shirking from battle, while only Tyrtaeus details the practical and material consequences. Dying in battle is a good thing. Surviving through laziness or cowardice is not only a bad and shameful thing but it utterly ruins a man.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
