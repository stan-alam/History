Assmann concedes that the subject of memory must be the individual, but the individual can organize and make sense of this memory only by relying on the “frame” provided by culture.12 Assmann elaborates on the relationship between the individual and the collective in terms of memory:                                                                  |

The difference is that the group memory has no neurological basis. This is replaced by culture: a complex of identity-shaping aspects of knowledge objectified in the symbolic forms of myth, song, dance, sayings, laws, sacred texts, pictures, ornaments, paintings, processional routes, or – as in the case of the Australians – even whole landscapes.|
