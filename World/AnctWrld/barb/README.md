We often think of the civilizations of ancient Greece and Rome as discrete incubators
of Western culture, places where ideas about everything from government to art to
philosophy were free to develop and then be distributed outward into the wider
Mediterranean world. But as Peter Bogucki reminds us in this book, Greece and
Rome did not develop in isolation. All around them were rural communities who
had remarkably different cultures, ones few of us know anything about. Telling
the stories of these nearly forgotten people, he offers a long-overdue enrichment
of how we think about classical antiquity.

As Bogucki shows, the lands to the north of the Greek and Roman peninsulas were
inhabited by non-literate communities that stretched across river valleys, mountains,
plains, and shorelines from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Ural Mountains in
the east. What we know about them is almost exclusively through archeological finds
of settlements, offerings, monuments, and burials—but these remnants paint a portrait
that is just as compelling as that of the great literate, urban civilizations of this
time. Bogucki sketches the development of these groups’ cultures from the Stone
Age through the collapse of the Roman Empire in the west, highlighting the increasing
complexity of their societal structures, their technological accomplishments, and
their distinct cultural practices. He shows that we are still learning much about
them, as he examines new historical and archeological discoveries as well as the
ways our knowledge about these groups has led to a vibrant tourist industry and
even influenced politics. The result is a fascinating account of several nearly
vanished cultures and the modern methods that have allowed us to rescue them from
historical oblivion.
