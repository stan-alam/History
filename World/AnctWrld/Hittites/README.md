  There is one group among the many ancient societies for which the history books have little to say. Their contributions to the scientific world rival some of the greatest discoveries by many of their counterparts. Their ability to match, and, at times, overcome their rivals on the battlefield marks them as a significant force in the cultural landscape of their region, considering some of their rivals were at this time.  These people were known as the Hittite. 

The Hittites were an ancient race of Indo-European people who came to rule over a land called Anatolia. It is surmised that prior to their establishment in this region, they were primarily a race of nomadic peasantry without a centralized region to call home. 

They were able to unite individual warring states into a cohesive country and unify multiple groups of people under one banner. The Hittite were able not only to indoctrinate effectively new people into their empire, but also worked to incorporate the elements that made these newly conquered people feel distinct and proud of their heritage. Any country today would be hard pressed to accomplish this much in this short a time frame.

  The general consensus is that the Old Kingdom began around the year 1750 B.C., though the Hittite existed in the region for an additional 250 years before this date. The year 1750 B.C. is reflective of the establishment of Hattusa being established as the permanent capital of Anatolia, a distinction it would hold until the final days of the New Kingdom. Records indicate that the accepted range of the Old Kingdom runs from 1750 B.C. until 1500 B.C. The Middle Kingdom existed briefly beginning in the year 1500 B.C. and lasting only a brief 50 years. The year 1450 B.C. begins what many call the New Kingdom when King Suppiluliumas I begins to turn the country of Anatolia into an empire. It is in this year that Suppiluliumas I conquers Syria
