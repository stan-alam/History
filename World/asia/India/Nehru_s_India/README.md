## Nehru’s India
**A History in Seven Myths**

His premiership (1947–64) is associated with a set of ideas, policies and institutions at the national and international level, especially non- alignment, secularism, socialism, the strong state, democracy and high modernism. The chapters in this book argue that  these supposed tenets of the Nehruvian period, including the idea that Nehru designed and oversaw their implementation, are myths.
Note: 1

. Rather, a myth is a story about the past, often with a grain of truth in it. 

Beyond this small kernel, however, the narrative takes on a life of its own as it is passed from one person to another. It is built not by the careful assemblage of con temporary evidence, but by repetition over time, especially by  those with authority.
Note: See cult of pythagorus. Epic of gilgamesh-flood story~   sargon of akkad and baby in reed basket.

One often finds the myths casually dropped into works of high scholarly repute and the credibility of  these statements is simply taken for granted. They are myths because they were, for many years, beyond question.
