Your glory shines high above the land, Your rays enrich the land you have created.   O Re, you reach to the ends of the earth, You bestow these lands on Akhenaten, your beloved son. Although you are far away, Your rays touch the earth. Although you shine on every human face, No one sees you go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
