It is situated on the east bank in a great bay of hills formed by the cliffs of the eastern desert, near Deir Mowas in Middle Egypt about half-way between Cairo and Luxor. In the middle of the fourteenth century B.C. Pharaoh Akhenaten chose this virgin site to be a new royal residence and capital city of all Egypt, and to be the centre of the state-cult of the sun-god in the form of Aten, “the Sun-disk”. The city with its temples, palaces, state buildings and great private mansions was soon built, and Akhenaten moved in with his Queen, Nefertiti and his court. The cult of the sun was the sole official cult in the city, in contrast to the normal Egyptian practice of worshipping many gods under many different forms. Akhenaten, “The Spirit of Aten” and his family were the principal devotees of the cult, in the universality of which Akhenaten came to believe to such an extent that late in his reign he gave orders for the names of all other gods to be chiselled out of temple inscriptions and monuments all over Egypt.|

It is true that after Akhenaten’s death, Aziru did ally himself with the Hittites against Egypt for motives of personal and local advantage. It is therefore quite probable that Rib-Addi was right that Aziru was playing a double game; but this was the game that all the Levantine and Syrian dynasts played, probably including Rib-Addi himself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

In the south a campaign was actually undertaken in Akhenaten’s name to suppress Beduin who were attacking the gold mines of Wadi El-Allaqi in Nubia,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The river quays appear to have opened directly on to the “Great Palace”, which comprises three separate constructions. The first, the “State Apartments”, is a stone building of vast proportions, partly lost under the cultivation. Probably it was entered from the north through a gateway leading on to a huge court surrounded with colossal statues of the King and Queen. A pillared portico on the south led into a transverse pillared hall and thence to a rectangular court. Beyond lay a series of three logitudinal pillared halls, which may have been throne rooms or audience chambers; they were flanked by colonnaded courts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
