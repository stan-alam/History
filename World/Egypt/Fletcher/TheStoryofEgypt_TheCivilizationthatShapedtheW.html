Splashing about in the middle of the desert within their aptly named &lsquo;Cave of Swimmers&rsquo;, the people they represent once plied the lake that then existed within Wadi Sura and formed a focus for social gatherings.

Yet &lsquo;the handprint motif in the Cave of Hands is one of the most remarkable and strongest pieces of evidence for connections between early Egyptians and the Sahara/inner Africa&rsquo;. </span></p><p class="c51"><span class="c8">4 </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) and Note | Location 205 </span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c5">some sixty miles west of the Nile, where wild cattle were being herded by around 8000 BC. A form of &lsquo;walking larder&rsquo; or &lsquo;walking blood banks&rsquo;, such cattle provided milk and blood for protein, as they still do today for the Maasai people; but since the cattle also represented the communities&rsquo; wealth, most meat was acquired through hunting gazelle, hare and ostrich and, later, the sheep and goats that were introduced from the Near East by about 6000 BC. </span></p><p class="c20"><span class="c8">05 </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) and Note | Location 216 </span></p><p class="c66"><span class="c5">But at more than 2,000 years older, it is the world&rsquo;s oldest known calendar &ndash; the first to be created by the sun- fixated Egyptians, who &lsquo;by their study of astronomy discovered the solar year . . . in my opinion their method of calculation is better than the Greeks&rdquo;, admitted a later Greek historian. Indeed, as &lsquo;the only rational calendar ever devised&rsquo;, this solar calendar with its origins in the Stone Age Sahara was the way the Egyptians would mark the passing of their entire history; it was adopted by the Romans, and then the papacy, eventually to become the calendar </span></p><p class="c51"><span class="c8">6 </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 226 </span></p><p class="c41"><span class="c5">There were also mounds topped with stones weighing up to two tons each, possibly marking the burials of Nabta&rsquo;s elite, and some fashioned with anthropomorphic shoulders &lsquo;suggesting that they served as stele, perhaps representing the dead.&rsquo; Like the calendar, they were carefully oriented to the northern hemisphere and the circumpolar stars, the brightest in the sky, which never set and which would later become known as the &lsquo;Imperishable Stars&rsquo;. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 233 </span></p><p class="c57"><span class="c5">Yet, by around 5500 BC the rain belt was gradually shifting south, and as the rains began to diminish, so too did the savannah grasslands. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 234 </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">Some of the last Neolithic inhabitants of the remaining savannah can be traced to the lakeside of Gebel Ramlah &ndash; &lsquo;Sandy Mountain&rsquo;&ndash;only twenty kilometres away from Nabta Playa. This apparently peaceful society, dated to around 5000 BC, was a blend of &lsquo;Mediterranean and sub-Saharan&rsquo; populations whose &lsquo;complex and exuberant material culture&rsquo; is represented by their tools of flint and granite, implements made from animal and fish bones, pottery beakers and bowls, and stone objects ranging from diorite vessels to an exquisite tilapia fish of irridescent mica, pierced for suspension by its female owner. </span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 247 </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">The suggestion that the grave acted as a womb from which the dead could be reborn is further reinforced by the fact that some bodies were &lsquo;practically covered&rsquo; with powdered red ochre &ndash; possibly representing the blood of childbirth, with the body itself placed in a contracted foetal postion. Yet this may simply have been a practical decision &ndash; allowing for the smallest possible hole to be dug! </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 250 </span></p><p class="c52"><span class="c5">Whatever the original motivation, such burials are typical for the men, women and children of fifth-millennium- BC Egypt, whose accompanying possessions strongly suggest a belief that they would still need them after death. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 255 </span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c5">Nor do the bones reveal any trace of violence; they indicate that the people of Gebel Ramlah were a peaceful community, well nourished, tall in stature and in relatively good health. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 258 </span></p><p class="c64"><span class="c5">ever eastwards, toward the nearest source of water &ndash; soon the only source of water &ndash; the mighty River Nile. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 264 </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c5">its furthest tributary, Rwanda&rsquo;s River Kagera, was only identified in 2006. As for the silt-bearing Blue Nile, which begins in Ethiopia and is generally claimed to originate in Lake Tana, it actually issues from a spring at Gish Abay, cared for by the &lsquo;Custodians of the Holy Waters&rsquo; of the Ethiopian Orthodox church. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 266 </span></p><p class="c60"><span class="c5">These two mighty rivers then unite at Khartoum to create the Nile itself, flowing 6,741 kilometres north from the heart of Africa to the Mediterranean Sea. As the world&rsquo;s longest river, it truly deserves its many superlatives, for without the Nile there would be no Egypt. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 287 </span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c5">Agriculture began here around 5500 BC, somewhat later than in the rest of the Near East, presumably because edible wild plants such as barley-like grasses and carbohydrate-rich sedge roots were easily available. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 299 </span></p><p class="c45"><span class="c5">toward the rising sun. But what is most striking about these early northern communities is that they buried their dead beside the living. At Maadi, the dead were buried beneath the houses in large pots, some thoughtfully provided with holes through which their souls could &lsquo;see&rsquo; out. </span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 314 </span></p><p class="c54"><span class="c5">The Maadi culture was certainly dynamic. Its northerly location was linked to neighbouring Palestine by sea, and by a 200-kilometre, ten-days&rsquo;-ride donkey train, along which was transported imports of wine, oil and the conifer resins burned as incense or exported further south. Trade was sufficiently brisk to encourage Palestinian traders to open businesses in Maadi, </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 323 </span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c5">Yet unlike their northern neighbours, the Badarians buried their dead away from their limited arable land, in burial grounds at the edge of the desert, whose dry environment has preserved what otherwise would have disappeared. And with these graves effectively acting as time capsules, bringing these most ancient Egyptians into the present, the ancient dead are by far the best way to understand the ancient living. Again in contrast with the northerners, southern Egyptians tended to face their dead west, toward the setting sun where </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 332 </span></p><p class="c62"><span class="c5">Some even shared human graves, including Egypt&rsquo;s earliest known </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 332 </span></p><p class="c61"><span class="c5">cat, buried with its male owner at Mostagedda around 4000 BC. The Badarian dead were certainly decked out as elaborately as their near contemporary neighbours at Gebel Ramlah; like them they must have undertaken &lsquo;collecting expeditions&rsquo; through the Eastern Desert to collect stones for adornment, malachite for eye-paint and the greeny-grey slate to make the palettes on which the cosmetic was prepared, sourced exclusively from the Black Mountains of the otherwise beige Wadi Hammamat. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 338 </span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c5">The man buried in Badarian Grave 5735 seems to have been something of a Predynastic dandy whose bracelets of seashells were complemented by a black fur pelt over a linen loincloth, overlaid by a nine-metre-long belt of green-glazed beads, wrapped repeatedly round his waist in a fashion known from other burials. A bead and seashell bracelet and matching anklet were worn by his female neighbour in Grave 5738, her beer supply accompanied by a pot of green eye-paint, thoughtfully placed in front of her face in the same way as others had their slate palettes placed beside their hands so they could prepare cosmetics </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 343 </span></p><p class="c28"><span class="c5">Yet the main type of Badarian grave goods were handmade pots, their characteristic black tops created by placing orangey-red clay vessels upside down in glowing embers to carbonise the top. The resulting black and red combination encapsulated in a simple, yet striking form the Egyptian landscape of Red Land, Black Land. And as black was also the colour of new life, while the red represented chaos and death, &lsquo;the two colours were combined to represent the contrast between life and death&rsquo;. </span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 353 </span></p><p class="c46"><span class="c5">wrapped in linen coated in a &lsquo;toffee-like&rsquo; substance, which has recently been identified as the same mixture found within the black-topped pots. And quite amazingly, carbon-dating of both the linen and the coating has produced a date of around 4300 BC, not only pre-dating all known embalming in the Old World, but almost 2,000 years earlier than mummification is supposed to have begun in Egypt. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 366 </span></p><p class="c68"><span class="c5">As another site that has given its name to an entire timespan, this was once thought to be a whole millennium, but recent scientific dating techniques have halved this &lsquo;to a period of roughly five centuries c.3800&ndash;3300 BC&rsquo;. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 376 </span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c5">The same continuity included the burial of animals alongside humans, but not only cattle, goats, sheep, dogs and cats, but again, at Hierakonpolis, also baboons, ostrich, hippo, crocodiles, a leopard and even elephants, whose wrapping in linen and matting must have been no small undertaking. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 378 </span></p><p class="c55"><span class="c5">Some of the human burials were sufficiently complete to reveal health problems: almost half of the fifty bodies studied from Gebelein tested positive for malaria; an elderly individual from Adaima was possibly the world&rsquo;s earliest victim of tuberculosis; and Hierakonpolis revealed several examples of achondroplasia, </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 386 </span></p><p class="c65"><span class="c5">A basket found at Hierakonpolis contained dried fruit, mint, chips of juniper and cypress wood, sedge tubers and &lsquo;chunks of resin&rsquo;, a veritable potpourri whose ingredients hint at the earliest version of the later classic fragrance kyphi, with its distinctive, Christmas-pudding-like smell. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 393 </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c5">As the weapon apparently used in Egypt&rsquo;s earliest known murder, its victim was none other than &lsquo;Gebelein Man&rsquo;, the naturally preserved body of an adult male in the British Museum known to generations of schoolchildren as &lsquo;Ginger&rsquo; on account of his red hair. Acquired by the museum in 1900 and the subject of public scrutiny for more than a century, only in 2012 did curators undertaking CT scans notice that Ginger had literally been stabbed in the back, around 3500 BC. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 397 </span></p><p class="c53"><span class="c5">In fact there is increasing evidence for violent deaths throughout this period, with cut throats, decapitation and smashed skulls found at Adaima, Hierakonpolis and Naga ed-D&ecirc;r, together with defence fractures to the arms from warding off blows.

It was a system used for almost a century, until modern scientific techniques created fixed dates, which continue to be refined and updated as Egypt&rsquo;s early history is pulled into ever-sharper focus. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 429 </span></p><p class="c38"><span class="c5">As studies of grave goods revealed &lsquo;the emergence of Homo hierarchicus&rsquo; by around 3500 BC, &lsquo;the tombs of women were larger and contained objects of greater interest than the graves of men&rsquo;. And, wanting their elevated status to be acknowledged after death, the male and female elite required rather more than the previous hole in the ground. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 441 </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">As the handle is also decorated with the same tall-prowed boats and hand-to-hand conflict found in the rock art of the Eastern Desert, early European Egyptologists assumed this must be evidence of a Mesopotamian &lsquo;Master </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">Race&rsquo;, that invaded, via the Red Sea, to bring civilisation to African Egypt.

Beads of garnet, carnelian and lapis were also popular, as, of course, was gold. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 456 </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c5">This growing contrast between the haves and have-nots was certainly apparent in the south&rsquo;s regional power centres of Abydos, Naqada and Hierakonpolis, all of which underwent rapid expansion, with fortifications, monumental buildings and imposing cemeteries. Their leaders were buried in ever more elaborate tombs with multiple chambers, surrounded by treasures befitting their status, beneath superstructures of imported cedar. Such tombs were even encircled with fencing, effectively proclaiming &lsquo;Keep Out&rsquo; to the masses. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 464 </span></p><p class="c50"><span class="c5">For the south would soon come to dominate the north, not only culturally and commercially, but ultimately politically, to create the first nation state anywhere in the world. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 471 </span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c5">crenellated </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 480 </span></p><p class="c71"><span class="c5">the Egyptians embellished, if not rewrote, their own history to create a more satisfyingly neat result. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 482 </span></p><p class="c28"><span class="c5">The cobra goddess Wadjet of Buto became the guardian of the north, and the vulture goddess Nekhbet of the Hierakonpolis region became protector of the south.

As polar opposites, they were also the heraldic deities of the rival sites Hierakonpolis and Naqada respectively. And brought together within the person of the king, his title &lsquo;The Two Lords at Peace Within Him&rsquo; was balanced by the earlier queen&rsquo;s title &lsquo;She Who Sees Horus and Seth&rsquo;, almost in the manner of a split personality. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 495 </span></p><p class="c40"><span class="c5">Egypt&rsquo;s two mythic capitals, and their equally mythic leaders, really did exist. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 495 </span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">Indeed, the legendary capital of the north, Buto, was believed to be fictitious until the original city was discovered in 1983, </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Highlight (Yellow) | Location 496 </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">twenty-three waterlogged feet beneath the modern settlement of Tell el-Fara&rsquo;in.
