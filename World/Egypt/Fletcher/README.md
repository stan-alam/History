The earliest human remains from Egypt are – perhaps appropriately – those of a child, who lived around Dendera some 55,000 years ago.

So striking are the images that, looking at them, the eight millennia that separate ancient artist and modem viewer suddenly disappear. For some of these little stick figures can be observed stretching out their arms and legs and swimming! Splashing about in the middle of the desert within their aptly named ‘Cave of Swimmers’, the people they represent once plied the lake that then existed within Wadi Sura and formed a focus for social gatherings. More of their swimming companions were discovered in 2002 in the nearby ‘Cave of Beasts’, in which some 8,000 animals and

A veritable trail of such handprints overlaid with incised figures have been found at sites further east toward the Nile Valley, both within the Farafra Oasis and in the ‘Cave of the Hands’ in a wadi so remote as to rarely feature on maps. Yet ‘the handprint motif in the Cave of Hands is one of the most remarkable and strongest pieces of evidence for connections between early Egyptians and the Sahara/inner Africa’.

some sixty miles west of the Nile, where wild cattle were being herded by around 8000 BC. A form of ‘walking larder’ or ‘walking blood banks’, such cattle provided milk and blood for protein, as they still do today for the Maasai people; but since the cattle also represented the communities’ wealth, most meat was acquired through hunting gazelle, hare and ostrich and, later, the sheep and goats that were introduced from the Near East by about 6000 BC.

But at more than 2,000 years older, it is the world’s oldest known calendar – the first to be created by the sun- fixated Egyptians, who ‘by their study of astronomy discovered the solar year . . . in my opinion their method of calculation is better than the Greeks”, admitted a later Greek historian. Indeed, as ‘the only rational calendar ever devised’, this solar calendar with its origins in the Stone Age Sahara was the way the Egyptians would mark the passing of their entire history; it was adopted by the Romans, and then the papacy, eventually to become the calendar

There were also mounds topped with stones weighing up to two tons each, possibly marking the burials of Nabta’s elite, and some fashioned with anthropomorphic shoulders ‘suggesting that they served as stele, perhaps representing the dead.’ Like the calendar, they were carefully oriented to the northern hemisphere and the circumpolar stars, the brightest in the sky, which never set and which would later become known as the ‘Imperishable Stars’.
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 233
Yet, by around 5500 BC the rain belt was gradually shifting south, and as the rains began to diminish, so too did the savannah grasslands.
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 234
Some of the last Neolithic inhabitants of the remaining savannah can be traced to the lakeside of Gebel Ramlah – ‘Sandy Mountain’–only twenty kilometres away from Nabta Playa. This apparently peaceful society, dated to around 5000 BC, was a blend of ‘Mediterranean and sub-Saharan’ populations whose ‘complex and exuberant material culture’ is represented by their tools of flint and granite, implements made from animal and fish bones, pottery beakers and bowls, and stone objects ranging from diorite vessels to an exquisite tilapia fish of irridescent mica, pierced for suspension by its female owner.
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 247
The suggestion that the grave acted as a womb from which the dead could be reborn is further reinforced by the fact that some bodies were ‘practically covered’ with powdered red ochre – possibly representing the blood of childbirth, with the body itself placed in a contracted foetal postion. Yet this may simply have been a practical decision – allowing for the smallest possible hole to be dug!
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 250
Whatever the original motivation, such burials are typical for the men, women and children of fifth-millennium- BC Egypt, whose accompanying possessions strongly suggest a belief that they would still need them after death.
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 255
Nor do the bones reveal any trace of violence; they indicate that the people of Gebel Ramlah were a peaceful community, well nourished, tall in stature and in relatively good health.

ever eastwards, toward the nearest source of water – soon the only source of water – the mighty River Nile.
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 264
its furthest tributary, Rwanda’s River Kagera, was only identified in 2006. As for the silt-bearing Blue Nile, which begins in Ethiopia and is generally claimed to originate in Lake Tana, it actually issues from a spring at Gish Abay, cared for by the ‘Custodians of the Holy Waters’ of the Ethiopian Orthodox church.
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 266
These two mighty rivers then unite at Khartoum to create the Nile itself, flowing 6,741 kilometres north from the heart of Africa to the Mediterranean Sea. As the world’s longest river, it truly deserves its many superlatives, for without the Nile there would be no Egypt.
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 287
Agriculture began here around 5500 BC, somewhat later than in the rest of the Near East, presumably because edible wild plants such as barley-like grasses and carbohydrate-rich sedge roots were easily available.
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 299
toward the rising sun. But what is most striking about these early northern communities is that they buried their dead beside the living. At Maadi, the dead were buried beneath the houses in large pots, some thoughtfully provided with holes through which their souls could ‘see’ out.
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 314
The Maadi culture was certainly dynamic. Its northerly location was linked to neighbouring Palestine by sea, and by a 200-kilometre, ten-days’-ride donkey train, along which was transported imports of wine, oil and the conifer resins burned as incense or exported further south. Trade was sufficiently brisk to encourage Palestinian traders to open businesses in Maadi,
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 323
Yet unlike their northern neighbours, the Badarians buried their dead away from their limited arable land, in burial grounds at the edge of the desert, whose dry environment has preserved what otherwise would have disappeared. And with these graves effectively acting as time capsules, bringing these most ancient Egyptians into the present, the ancient dead are by far the best way to understand the ancient living. Again in contrast with the northerners, southern Egyptians tended to face their dead west, toward the setting sun where
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 332
Some even shared human graves, including Egypt’s earliest known

cat, buried with its male owner at Mostagedda around 4000 BC. The Badarian dead were certainly decked out as elaborately as their near contemporary neighbours at Gebel Ramlah; like them they must have undertaken ‘collecting expeditions’ through the Eastern Desert to collect stones for adornment, malachite for eye-paint and the greeny-grey slate to make the palettes on which the cosmetic was prepared, sourced exclusively from the Black Mountains of the otherwise beige Wadi Hammamat.
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 338
The man buried in Badarian Grave 5735 seems to have been something of a Predynastic dandy whose bracelets of seashells were complemented by a black fur pelt over a linen loincloth, overlaid by a nine-metre-long belt of green-glazed beads, wrapped repeatedly round his waist in a fashion known from other burials. A bead and seashell bracelet and matching anklet were worn by his female neighbour in Grave 5738, her beer supply accompanied by a pot of green eye-paint, thoughtfully placed in front of her face in the same way as others had their slate palettes placed beside their hands so they could prepare cosmetics
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 343
Yet the main type of Badarian grave goods were handmade pots, their characteristic black tops created by placing orangey-red clay vessels upside down in glowing embers to carbonise the top. The resulting black and red combination encapsulated in a simple, yet striking form the Egyptian landscape of Red Land, Black Land. And as black was also the colour of new life, while the red represented chaos and death, ‘the two colours were combined to represent the contrast between life and death’.
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 353
wrapped in linen coated in a ‘toffee-like’ substance, which has recently been identified as the same mixture found within the black-topped pots. And quite amazingly, carbon-dating of both the linen and the coating has produced a date of around 4300 BC, not only pre-dating all known embalming in the Old World, but almost 2,000 years earlier than mummification is supposed to have begun in Egypt.
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 366
As another site that has given its name to an entire timespan, this was once thought to be a whole millennium, but recent scientific dating techniques have halved this ‘to a period of roughly five centuries c.3800–3300 BC’.
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 376
The same continuity included the burial of animals alongside humans, but not only cattle, goats, sheep, dogs and cats, but again, at Hierakonpolis, also baboons, ostrich, hippo, crocodiles, a leopard and even elephants, whose wrapping in linen and matting must have been no small undertaking.
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 378
Some of the human burials were sufficiently complete to reveal health problems: almost half of the fifty bodies studied from Gebelein tested positive for malaria; an elderly individual from Adaima was possibly the world’s earliest victim of tuberculosis; and Hierakonpolis revealed several examples of achondroplasia,
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 386
A basket found at Hierakonpolis contained dried fruit, mint, chips of juniper and cypress wood, sedge tubers and ‘chunks of resin’, a veritable potpourri whose ingredients hint at the earliest version of the later classic fragrance kyphi, with its distinctive, Christmas-pudding-like smell.
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 393
As the weapon apparently used in Egypt’s earliest known murder, its victim was none other than ‘Gebelein Man’, the naturally preserved body of an adult male in the British Museum known to generations of schoolchildren as ‘Ginger’ on account of his red hair. Acquired by the museum in 1900 and the subject of public scrutiny for more than a century, only in 2012 did curators undertaking CT scans notice that Ginger had literally been stabbed in the back, around 3500 BC.
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 397
In fact there is increasing evidence for violent deaths throughout this period, with cut throats, decapitation and smashed skulls found at Adaima, Hierakonpolis and Naga ed-Dêr, together with defence fractures to the arms from warding off blows. And weapons continue to be found in the burials of men and women alike, from bows and arrows to the mace-heads regarded as both ‘symbols of authority’ and ‘symbols of protection’.
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 401
star-tipped horns of the celestial cow goddess who would come to represent Hathor to the doublebarbed arrow of the fertility god Min.
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 402
Such palettes also portray hunting scenes in which the hunters wear masks to resemble their prey. The keen vision essential for the hunt was ritually enhanced by the cosmetics prepared on the palettes, emphasising the features and, like ancient sunglasses, reducing the glare of the sun. It also repelled the flies responsible for spreading eye disease, even acting as an antibacterial – the copper content of malachite inhibits Staphylococcus aureus, a leading cause of skin infection.
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 412
The cow would soon become emblematic of Hathor, patron of dance, and as she was also the goddess who cared for dead souls, the clay models of cattle placed in Naqada graves and assumed to sustain the dead as an eternal food source would be equally able to do this as representatives of the bovine divine.
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 414
With these same balletic ‘cow-dancers’ portrayed in rock art, one dominant figure in scenes in the Eastern Desert’s Wadi Umm Salam has a crown of tall plumes and a giant erection, key attributes of the fertility god Min. This is perhaps ‘the earliest known image of a god in ancient Egyptian religion’. And dating from 4000 BC, the earliest known portrait of a pharaoh-style leader
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 423
Egypt’s preliterate history, using a system of ‘sequence dating’, in which gradual changes in the style of the pots were plotted chronologically to create a timeframe of relative dates. It was a system used for almost a century, until modern scientific techniques created fixed dates, which continue to be refined and updated as Egypt’s early history is pulled into ever-sharper focus.
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 429
As studies of grave goods revealed ‘the emergence of Homo hierarchicus’ by around 3500 BC, ‘the tombs of women were larger and contained objects of greater interest than the graves of men’. And, wanting their elevated status to be acknowledged after death, the male and female elite required rather more than the previous hole in the ground.
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 441
As the handle is also decorated with the same tall-prowed boats and hand-to-hand conflict found in the rock art of the Eastern Desert, early European Egyptologists assumed this must be evidence of a Mesopotamian ‘Master
Race’, that invaded, via the Red Sea, to bring civilisation to African Egypt. This they rapidly transformed into ‘das Volk und das Reich’ – the people and the empire – of the Pharaohs, a once-influential theory
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 444
reflecting unfortunate attitudes prevalent in 1930s Europe, so later rebranded the ‘Dynastic Race’. Yet this is now seriously undermined by the wealth of evidence that the origins of much of Egyptian culture emerged instead from the Western Desert and the Sahara.

Egypt via the Wadi Hammamat’, they were doing so in order to trade, rather than to conquer, their unmistakable cultural influence on Egypt ranging from mud-brick walls with repeated recesses known as ‘palace façade’ panelling to the carving of ivory, from furniture legs modelled on bulls’ and lions’ feet to delicate ivory combs and hairpins. Beads of garnet, carnelian and lapis were also popular, as, of course, was gold.
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 456
This growing contrast between the haves and have-nots was certainly apparent in the south’s regional power centres of Abydos, Naqada and Hierakonpolis, all of which underwent rapid expansion, with fortifications, monumental buildings and imposing cemeteries. Their leaders were buried in ever more elaborate tombs with multiple chambers, surrounded by treasures befitting their status, beneath superstructures of imported cedar. Such tombs were even encircled with fencing, effectively proclaiming ‘Keep Out’ to the masses.

The cobra goddess Wadjet of Buto became the guardian of the north, and the vulture goddess Nekhbet of the Hierakonpolis region became protector of the south. Known as ‘The Two Mighty Ones’, each was regarded as the king’s divine mother, sinuous Wadjet the uraeus (from the ancient Iaret – ‘cobra’), rearing up to strike and bring death to royal enemies, whose corpses were then consumed by her vulture sister Nekhbet.
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 487
This same duality extended to male gods, with Horus, god of kingship, balanced by Seth, god of chaos. As polar opposites, they were also the heraldic deities of the rival sites Hierakonpolis and Naqada respectively. And brought together within the person of the king, his title ‘The Two Lords at Peace Within Him’ was balanced by the earlier queen’s title ‘She Who Sees Horus and Seth’, almost in the manner of a split personality.
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 495
Egypt’s two mythic capitals, and their equally mythic leaders, really did exist.
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 495
Indeed, the legendary capital of the north, Buto, was believed to be fictitious until the original city was discovered in 1983,
Highlight (Yellow) | Location 496
twenty-three waterlogged feet beneath the modern settlement of Tell el-Fara’in. Here the stratified layers revealed that Buto was originally a place of reed-woven wattle houses, and a temple, made of this same ephemeral material. And it was here amidst the verdant groves of Buto that the goddess Isis was said to have hidden herself following the murder of her brother-husband Osiris by their jealous brother Seth.

Buto to defeat Seth in the so-called ‘Butic Cycle’, a rich mythical history that spread out beyond Egypt to influence beliefs right along the Levantine coast.

Although she is not named, she is most probaby Scorpion’s mother or wife, observing events that are both celebratory and sinister. For not only is Scorpion flanked by small male figures who bear fans and the standards of his allies, other regional standards have been transformed into makeshift gibbets, from which swing the bodies of lapwings, symbols of those who had opposed the Ruler in his attempts to unite the south.

This was the legendary King Narmer, traditionally credited with uniting the two halves of Egypt around 3100 BC to create the world’s first nation state and ‘the forerunner of all modern countries’.

The ensemble creates a rebus set of hieroglyphs to be read ‘The king has defeated 6,000 of the Delta enemy’, such scenes now functioning as both an art form and a language.

Even optimum flood levels covered the land for several months each year when, like the primeval waters at the beginning of time ‘the whole country is converted into a sea, and the towns, which alone remain above water, look like the islands in the Aegean. At these times water transport is used all over the country, instead of merely along the course of the river’.
