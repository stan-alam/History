The archive of note slips that were used to compile this dictionary—still a standard reference for hieroglyphic texts—has now been digitized. By inputting the page number and word entry from the published Wörterbuch, we can scroll through scans of paper slips containing handwritten copies of snippets of ancient Egyptian texts containing a particular word.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The verb ab (3b), “to cease,” appears usually to take walking legs as a determinative. The verb we chose, abey (3bi), “to desire, to wish,” normally has a tied-up papyrus scroll as a determinative. Of the two verbs, according to the dictionaries, “to desire, to wish” is the one more likely to appear without a determinative.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

On the day in question, February 22, 1347 BCE (give or take a week or two), there were only a few places in the world where such knowledge even had a chance of surviving. Of course, Egypt had hieroglyphs—the “word of god” as the Egyptians termed it. The ancient Near East employed the cuneiform script, first developed for Sumerian in the southern portion of Mesopotamia (roughly the modern countries between the eastern Mediterranean coast and the Tigris River), then adapted for Akkadian and later for Hittite (and other languages). Early Greek was written in the syllabic Linear B script of the Mycenaean world, while in Shang Dynasty China, written characters were in use as aspects of divinatory practices. As far as we know, no other culture possessed a writing system at this time.|
