The archive of note slips that were used to compile this dictionary—still a standard reference for hieroglyphic texts—has now been digitized. By inputting the page number and word entry from the published Wörterbuch, we can scroll through scans of paper slips containing handwritten copies of snippets of ancient Egyptian texts containing a particular word.|

On pages 6–7 we indeed see several words with the basic spelling of ab (listed in the dictionary under the transliteration 3b). We note that abeb might well be a writing of the word “abey” (transliteration 3bi), “to desire, to wish.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The verb ab (3b), “to cease,” appears usually to take walking legs as a determinative. The verb we chose, abey (3bi), “to desire, to wish,” normally has a tied-up papyrus scroll as a determinative. Of the two verbs, according to the dictionaries, “to desire, to wish” is the one more likely to appear without a determinative.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
