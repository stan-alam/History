## notes on the story of the Earth

```text
Hailed by The New York Times for writing “with wonderful clarity about science . . .
that effortlessly teaches as it zips along,” nationally bestselling author Robert M.
Hazen offers a radical new approach to Earth history in this intertwined tale of the
planet’s living and nonliving spheres. With an astrobiologist’s imagination, a historian’s
perspective, and a naturalist’s eye, Hazen calls upon twenty-first-century discoveries that
have revolutionized geology and enabled scientists to envision Earth’s many iterations in
vivid detail—from the mile-high lava tides of its infancy to the early organisms responsible
for more than two-thirds of the mineral varieties beneath our feet. Lucid, controversial, and on
the cutting edge of its field, The Story of Earth is popular science of the highest order.
“Concise and colourful . . . Drawing on the latest research and influenced by advances in
astrobiology, Hazen takes a radical standpoint . . . to tell the amazing tale of our planet’s
intertwined living and non-living spheres.”
—Birger Schmitz, Nature
“A fascinating new theory on the Earth’s origins written in a sparkling style with many personal
touches . . . Hazen offers startling evidence that ‘Earth’s living and nonliving spheres’ have
co-evolved over the past four billion years.”
—Kirkus Reviews (starred)

“Exceptionally readable [and] user-friendly . . . Science junkies and readers interested in the
environment will find Hazen’s arguments compelling and his overview of Earth’s tumultuous history
captivating.”
—Carl Hays, Booklist

“Hazen has a gift for explaining science in lay terms, and even readers with a minimal understanding
of geology, chemistry, and physics will find this book riveting.”
—Nancy R. Curtis, Library Journal
