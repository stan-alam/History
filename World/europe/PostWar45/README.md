## notes on Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945
**Tony Judt**

```text
Postwar is the first modern history that covers all of Europe, both east and west,
drawing on research in six languages to sweep readers through thirty-four nations
and sixty years of political and cultural change-all in one integrated, enthralling
narrative. Both intellectually ambitious and compelling to read, thrilling in its
scope and delightful in its small details, Postwar is a rare joy.
