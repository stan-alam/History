## notes on 'Mockba 1937'

Russian History
This is one of the most remarkable works of history I have ever come across. It is a collection of in depth essays, all by Karl Schl?gel, on different aspects of life at the height of Stalin's Great Terror of 1937-38, covering topics as the construction of the Moscow-Volga canal, the Soviet representation at the Paris exposition, the methods used by Stalin's executioners, the show trials of political dissidents, among many more. Together, they provide an intimate sense of having lived through this terrible and traumatic period. A truly beautiful and inspiring work of scholarship.

I was still at school, at the beginning of the 1960s, when I heard Yevgeny Yevtushenko recite his poem ‘The Heirs of Stalin’. Even for people unfamiliar with the whole history, the verses gave expression to something sinister, ominous and opaque that must never be allowed to recur, a catastrophe that had befallen a people and a nation. This was repeated over the years and developed into a leitmotif. In the circle of acquaintances to which I subsequently belonged in Moscow there was no one whose family did not contain a victim: relatives that had disappeared, children who did not know when and where their fathers had been shot, and families scattered throughout the Soviet Union during those years. The traces of violence, misfortune and arbitrary rule were everywhere to be seen. 

right to the very end of the Soviet Union, there were no memorials to commemorate the dead and to give the collective trauma a public face.
