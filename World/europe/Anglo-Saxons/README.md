The Anglo-Saxons: A History of the Beginnings of England: 400 – 1066


 At the time of the Sutton Hoo burial, the picture was very different. What would eventually become England was a gaggle of smaller kingdoms, all vying against each other for temporary advantage. None of them had a settlement of more than a few hundred people, or silver coins, or much in the way of trade. Nor was there much organized Christianity, which had arrived only a generation earlier, and had so far made very little progress: almost everyone was still pagan, worshipping gods like Thunor, Frig and Woden. King Harold, who lived in a world of bishops, boroughs, shires and sheriffs, would probably have felt far more at home with the English of the later Middle Ages than the people who had buried their lord in a boat over four centuries earlier. Those intervening centuries had been ones of fundamental transformation.

admirable: their courage, their piety, their resourcefulness, their artistry, and their professed love of freedom. But we will also find much that is disconcerting: their brutality, their intolerance, their misogyny, and their reliance on the labour of slaves. Their society produced works of art that continue to dazzle, and institutions that are still with us today, **but it was highly unequal, patriarchal, persecuting and theocratic.**

the first two centuries after the end of Roman rule, we have virtually no written records of any kind, and are almost entirely reliant on archaeology. The situation improves as the period progresses, and richer material survives, but there are still huge gaps in our knowledge. Sometimes major events are known to us only because of an allusive reference in a charter or a single excavated coin.

What we cannot say for sure is whether he was still alive at the time it was buried. But when it comes to determining when that time was, we are on firmer ground, thanks to the presence of the coins. These can be dated from the images of the emperors that appear on them, and the latest examples in the hoard were minted between AD 407 and 408. How soon after that date the hoard was buried is another matter.1

When the numbers of known hoards in the British Isles across the centuries are plotted on a graph, the greatest spike by a very long margin occurs during the Civil War of the 1640s, but there are also sharp increases at the time of the Norman Conquest and the viking invasions.

In the 1960s, a cemetery was discovered at Poundbury in Dorset, just outside the Roman town of Dorchester, containing the remains of over 1,200 ordinary fourth-century Britons. The majority of bones showed signs of wear and tear associated with years of hard labour and long-term malnutrition. In the estimation of the historian David Mattingly, ‘for every winner under Roman rule there were a hundred losers’.
