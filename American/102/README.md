## notes on 102 Minutes

```text
102 Minutes is a 2005 National Book Award Finalist for Nonfiction.

Hailed upon its hardcover publication as an instant classic, the critically
acclaimed New York Times bestseller 102 Minutes is now available in a revised
edition timed to honor the tenth anniversary of the attacks of September 11, 2001.

At 8:46 a.m. that morning, fourteen thousand people were inside the World Trade
Center just starting their workdays, but over the next 102 minutes, each would
become part of a drama for the ages. Of the millions of words written about this
wrenching day, most were told from the outside looking in. New York Times reporters
Jim Dwyer and Kevin Flynn draw on hundreds of interviews with rescuers and survivors,
thousands of pages of oral histories, and countless phone, e-mail, and emergency
radio transcripts to tell the story of September 11 from the inside looking out.

Dwyer and Flynn have woven an epic and unforgettable account of the struggle,
determination, and grace of the ordinary men and women who made 102 minutes count
as never before.

Drawn from thousands of radio transcripts, phone messages, e-mails and interviews
with eyewitnesses, this 9/11 account comes from the perspective of those inside the
World Trade Center from the moment the first plane hit at 8:46 a.m. to the collapse
of the north tower at 10:28 a.m. The stories are intensely intimate, and they often
stir gut-wrenching emotions. A law firm receptionist quietly eats yogurt at her desk
seconds before impact. Injured survivors, sidestepping debris and bodies, struggle down a
stairwell. A man trapped on the 88th floor leaves a phone message for his fiancée: “Kris,
there’s been an explosion…. I want you to know my life has been so much better and richer
because you were in it.” Dwyer and Flynn, New York Times writers, take rescue agencies to
task for rampant communications glitches and argue that the towers’ faulty design helped
doom those above the affected floors (“Their fate had been sealed nearly four decades
earlier, when… fire stairs were eliminated as a wasteful use of valuable space”). In
doing so, the authors frequently draw parallels to similar safety oversights aboard the
ill-fated Titanic nearly 90 years before. Their reporting skills are exceptional; readers
experience the chaos and confusion that unfolded inside, in grim, painstaking detail. ~ Publisher Weekly
“102 Minutes does for the September 11 catastrophe what Walter Lord did for the Titanic in
his masterpiece, A Night to Remember . . . Searing, poignant, and utterly compelling.”
—Rick Atkinson, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of An Army at Dawn
