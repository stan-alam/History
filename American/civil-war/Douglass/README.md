A NEW YORK TIMES, WALL STREET JOURNAL, and TIME TOP 10 BOOK OF THE YEAR

The definitive, dramatic biography of the most important African American of the
nineteenth century: Frederick Douglass, the escaped slave who became the greatest orator
of his day and one of the leading abolitionists and writers of the era.

As a young man Frederick Douglass (1818–1895) escaped from slavery in Baltimore, Maryland.
He was fortunate to have been taught to read by his slave owner mistress, and he would go on
to become one of the major literary figures of his time. He wrote three versions of his
autobiography over the course of his lifetime and published his own newspaper. His very
existence gave the lie to slave owners: with dignity and great intelligence he bore witness
to the brutality of slavery.

Initially mentored by William Lloyd Garrison, Douglass spoke widely, often to large crowds,
using his own story to condemn slavery. He broke with Garrison to become a political
abolitionist, a Republican, and eventually a Lincoln supporter. By the Civil War and during
Reconstruction, Douglass became the most famed and widely travelled orator in the nation.
He denounced the premature end of Reconstruction and the emerging Jim Crow era. In his
unique and eloquent voice, written and spoken, Douglass was a fierce critic of the United
States as well as a radical patriot. He sometimes argued politically with younger African
Americans, but he never forsook either the Republican party or the cause of black civil and political rights.

In this remarkable biography, David Blight has drawn on new information held in a private
collection that few other historian have consulted, as well as recently discovered issues of
Douglass’s newspapers. Blight tells the fascinating story of Douglass’s two marriages and his
complex extended family. Douglass was not only an astonishing man of words, but a thinker
steeped in Biblical story and theology. There has not been a major biography of Douglass
in a quarter century. David Blight’s Frederick Douglass affords this important American
the distinguished biography he deserves.
