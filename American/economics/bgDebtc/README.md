## notes on 'Big Debt Crises'

```text
On the 10th anniversary of the 2008 financial crisis, one of the world’s most
successful investors, Ray Dalio, shares his unique template for how debt crises
work and principles for dealing with them well. This template allowed his firm,
Bridgewater Associates, to anticipate events and navigate them well while others
struggled badly.

As he explained in his #1 New York Times Bestseller, Principles: Life & Work,
Dalio believes that most everything happens over and over again through time so
that by studying their patterns one can understand the cause-effect relationships
behind them and develop principles for dealing with them well. In this 3-part
research series, he does that for big debt crises and shares his template in the
hopes reducing the chances of big debt crises happening and helping them be better
managed in the future.

The template comes in three parts provided in three books: 1) The Archetypal
Big Debt Cycle (which explains the template), 2) 3 Detailed Cases (which examines
in depth the 2008 financial crisis, the 1930’s Great Depression, and the 1920’s
inflationary depression of Germany’s Weimar Republic), and 3) Compendium of 48 Cases
(which is a compendium of charts and brief descriptions of the worst debt
crises of the last 100 years). Whether you’re an investor, a policy maker,
or are simply interested, the unconventional perspective of one of the few people
who navigated the crises successfully, A Template for Understanding Big Debt Crises
will help you understand the economy and markets in revealing new ways.
