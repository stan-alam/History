**notes on Middle Class**

```text
Families today are squeezed on every side—from high childcare costs and harsh employment
policies to workplaces without paid family leave or even dependable and regular working
hours. Many realize that attaining the standard of living their parents managed has become impossible.

Alissa Quart, executive editor of the Economic Hardship Reporting Project, examines
the lives of many middle-class Americans who can now barely afford to raise children.
Through gripping firsthand storytelling, Quart shows how our country has failed its
families. Her subjects—from professors to lawyers to caregivers to nurses—have been
wrung out by a system that doesn’t support them, and enriches only a tiny elite.

Interlacing her own experience with close-up reporting on families that are
just getting by, Quart reveals parenthood itself to be financially overwhelming,
except for the wealthiest. She offers real solutions to these problems, including
outlining necessary policy shifts, as well as detailing the DIY tactics
some families are already putting into motion, and argues for the cultural
reevaluation of parenthood and caregiving.
