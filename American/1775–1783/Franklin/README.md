## notes on Franklin - Walter Isaacson
```text
In this authoritative and engrossing full-scale biography, Walter Isaacson,
bestselling author of Einstein and Steve Jobs, shows how the most fascinating of
 America’s founders helped define our national character.

Benjamin Franklin is the founding father who winks at us, the one who seems made
of flesh rather than marble. In a sweeping narrative that follows Franklin’s life
from Boston to Philadelphia to London and Paris and back, Walter Isaacson chronicles
the adventures of the runaway apprentice who became, over the course of his eighty-four-year life,
America’s best writer, inventor, media baron, scientist, diplomat, and business strategist, as
well as one of its most practical and ingenious political leaders. He explores the wit behind
Poor Richard’s Almanac and the wisdom behind the Declaration of Independence, the new nation’s
alliance with France, the treaty that ended the Revolution, and the compromises that created a
near-perfect Constitution.

In this colorful and intimate narrative, Isaacson provides the full sweep of Franklin’s
amazing life, showing how he helped to forge the American national identity and why he has a
particular resonance in the twenty-first century.

Most people’s mental image of Ben Franklin is that of an aged man with wire-rim glasses and a
comb-over, flying a kite in a thunder storm, or of the spirited face that stares back from a
one-hundred-dollar bill. Isaacson’s (Kissinger) biography does much to remind us of Franklin’s
amazing depth and breadth. At once a scientist, craftsman, writer, publisher, comic, sage,
ladies’ man, statesman, diplomat and inventor, Franklin not only wore many hats, but in many cases,
did not have an equal. The most intriguing thing he invented, and continued to reinvent, according
to Isaacson, was himself. Three-time Tony winner Gaines has an obvious interest and affinity for the
material. His delivery of Isaacson’s factual yet fascinating biography is informative and friendly
with an instructional yet casual tone, like that of a gregarious narrator of an educational film.
All things considered, Gaines is a good match for the material. He has the authority to deliver
historical facts and the enthusiasm to keep listeners interested. ~ Publisher Weekly
