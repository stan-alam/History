## notes on 'story of the world of 1776.'
```text
One-third of the men who signed the Declaration of Independence were not of English stock.
Eight were first-generation immigrants. It was in recognition of the mixed European
background of so many Americans that John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson
proposed that the seal of the United States bear the national emblems of France, Germany,
Holland, Ireland, Scotland, and England, thus “pointing out the countries from which
these States have been peopled.”

Many came, as Thomas Paine stated, in search of asylum. But they also came with an
intent to preserve and refresh aspects of life in their homelands.

In 1776, Europe boasted a rich civilization, alive with dynamic ideas, flourishing
arts, and promising concepts in science. The foundations of industry and business
were established, and social reforms were being undertaken, which Europeans took
with them as they colonized and traded. They had come in contact with Eastern
civilizations, above all, China. Here, from award-winning historian Marshall B.
Davidson, is the story of the world of 1776.
