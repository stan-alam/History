## Notes on 'The First Conspiracy: The Secret Plot to Kill George Washington'

```text

In 1776, an elite group of soldiers were handpicked to serve as George Washingtonâ€™s
bodyguards. Washington trusted them; relied on them. But unbeknownst to Washington,
some of them were part of a treasonous plan. In the months leading up to the Revolutionary
War, these traitorous soldiers, along with the Governor of New York, William Tryon, and Mayor
David Mathews, launched a deadly plot against the most important member of the military:
George Washington himself.

This is the story of the secret plot and how it was revealed. It is a story of leaders, liars,
counterfeiters, and jailhouse confessors. It also shows just how hard the battle was for George
 Washington and how close America was to losing the Revolutionary War.

In this historical page-turner, New York Times bestselling author Brad Meltzer teams up with
American history writer and documentary television producer, Josh Mensch to unravel the shocking
true story behind what has previously been a footnote in the pages of history. Drawing on extensive
research, Meltzer and Mensch capture in riveting detail how George Washington not only defeated the
most powerful military force in the world, but also uncovered the secret plot against him in the
tumultuous days leading up to July 4, 1776.
