## notes on Hamilton 
```text
In the first full-length biography of Alexander Hamilton in decades, Ron Chernow tells
the riveting story of a man who overcame all odds to shape, inspire, and scandalize the
newborn America. According to historian Joseph Ellis, Alexander Hamilton is “a robust
full-length portrait, in my view the best ever written, of the most brilliant, charismatic
and dangerous founder of them all.”
Few figures in American history have been more hotly debated or more grossly misunderstood
than Alexander Hamilton. Chernow’s biography gives Hamilton his due and sets the record straight,
deftly illustrating that the political and economic greatness of today’s America is the result of
Hamilton’s countless sacrifices to champion ideas that were often wildly disputed during his time.
“To repudiate his legacy,” Chernow writes, “is, in many ways, to repudiate the modern world.”
Chernow here recounts Hamilton’s turbulent life: an illegitimate, largely self-taught orphan
from the Caribbean, he came out of nowhere to take America by storm, rising to become George
Washington’s aide-de-camp in the Continental Army, coauthoring The Federalist Papers,
founding the Bank of New York, leading the Federalist Party, and becoming the first Treasury
Secretary of the United States.
Historians have long told the story of America’s birth as the triumph of Jefferson’s democratic
ideals over the aristocratic intentions of Hamilton. Chernow presents an entirely different man,
whose legendary ambitions were motivated not merely by self-interest but by passionate patriotism
and a stubborn will to build the foundations of American prosperity and power. His is a Hamilton
far more human than we’ve encountered before—from his shame about his birth to his fiery aspirations,
from his intimate relationships with childhood friends to his titanic feuds with Jefferson, Madison,
Adams, Monroe, and Burr, and from his highly public affair with Maria Reynolds to his loving marriage
to his loyal wife Eliza. And never before has there been a more vivid account of Hamilton’s famous and
mysterious death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July of 1804.
Chernow’s biography is not just a portrait of Hamilton, but the story of America’s birth seen through
its most central figure. At a critical time to look back to our roots, Alexander Hamilton will
remind readers of the purpose of our institutions and our heritage as Americans.
