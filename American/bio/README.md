## notes on 'American Prometheus'

```text
J. Robert Oppenheimer is one of the iconic figures of the twentieth century, a
brilliant physicist who led the effort to build the atomic bomb for his country
in a time of war, and who later found himself confronting the moral consequences
of scientific progress. In this magisterial, acclaimed biography twenty-five years
in the making, Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin capture Oppenheimer’s life and times,
from his early career to his central role in the Cold War. This is biography and
history at its finest, riveting and deeply informative.

Though many recognize Oppenheimer (1904–1967) as the father of the atomic bomb, few
are as familiar with his career before and after Los Alamos. Sherwin (A World Destroyed)
has spent 25 years researching every facet of Oppenheimer’s life, from his childhood on
Manhattan’s Upper West Side and his prewar years as a Berkeley physicist to his public
humiliation when he was branded a security risk at the height of anticommunist hysteria
in 1954. Teaming up with Bird, an acclaimed Cold War historian (The Color of Truth),
Sherwin examines the evidence surrounding Oppenheimer’s “hazy and vague” connections
to the Communist Party in the 1930s—loose interactions consistent with the activities
of contemporary progressives. But those politics, in combination with Oppenheimer’s
abrasive personality, were enough for conservatives, from fellow scientist Edward Teller
to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, to work at destroying Oppenheimer’s postwar reputation
and prevent him from swaying public opinion against the development of a hydrogen bomb.
Bird and Sherwin identify Atomic Energy Commission head Lewis Strauss as the ringleader
of a “conspiracy” that culminated in a security clearance hearing designed as a “show trial.”
Strauss’s tactics included illegal wiretaps of Oppenheimer’s attorney; those transcripts
and other government documents are invaluable in debunking the charges against Oppenheimer.
The political drama is enhanced by the close attention to Oppenheimer’s personal life, and
Bird and Sherwin do not conceal their occasional frustration with his arrogant stonewalling
and panicky blunders, even as they shed light on the psychological roots for those failures,
restoring human complexity to a man who had been both elevated and demonized. -Publisher Weekly
