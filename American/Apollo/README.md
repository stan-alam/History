## notes on 'the man on the Moon'

```text
This acclaimed portrait of heroism and ingenuity captures a watershed moment in human history.
The astronauts themselves have called it the definitive account of their missions. On the night of
July 20, 1969, our world changed forever when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the moon.
Based on in-depth interviews with twenty-three of the twenty-four moon voyagers, as well as those
who struggled to get the program moving, A Man on the Moon conveys every aspect of the Apollo
missions with breathtaking immediacy and stunning detail.

A decade in the making, this book is based on hundreds of hours of in-depth interviews with
each of the twenty-four moon voyagers, as well as those who contributed their brain power,
training and teamwork on Earth. In his preface Chaikin writes, “We touched the face of another
world and became a people without limits.”

What follows are thrilling accounts of such remarkable experiences as the rush of a liftoff,
the heart-stopping touchdown on the moon, the final hurdle of re-entry, competition for a seat on
a moon flight, the tragic spacecraft fire, and the search for clues to the origin of the
solar system on the slopes of lunar mountains. –Therese Littleton –This text refers to an
